    New Relic is a SaaS-based cloud application performance management provider that offers rich application performance data as part of its service. Cedexis Openmix can use this data to take action on the current state of your application as measured by New Relic. For example, if New Relic reports high CPU load on an application you can have Openmix direct traffic to a less loaded instance of your application.

    This sample application demonstrates the use of New Relic data in an Openmix application.
